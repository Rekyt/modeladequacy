# Adequacy for phylogenetic trait models

This is the repo for our project on assessing the adequacy of continuous trait models. This is a collaborative effort between [Matt Pennell](http://mwpennell.github.io), [Rich FitzJohn](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~fitzjohn/), [Will Cornwell](http://phylodiversity.net/wcornwell/) and [Luke Harmon](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~lukeh/). As part of this project, we also developed a R package [arbutus](https://github.com/mwpennell/arbutus) so that researchers can apply our approach to their own data.

## Contents
