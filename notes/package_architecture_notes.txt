## Notes on design of quercus architecture

create a class of object called "unit.tree", containing the following elements
	
	'phylo' object (and all its structures)
		'phylo' object will be scaled by model fit
	trait data (required for computation of some summary stats)
	pics (contrasts and variances)
	
	
		
fxn: as.unit.tree() builds 'unit tree'. takes the followings args
	
	'phylo' object -- tree used in the analysis
	trait data
	
	

fxn: phylo.model() rescales tree from model fit. takes the args:	
	
	phylo object (unscaled)
	vcv matrix -- inherited from fitting model
	weight matrix -- inherited from fitting model with multiple means
		default=NULL
		
	returns a phylo object which has been rescaled	
	
	
		
set of fxns to parse output from various programs
	e.g. parse.fitContinuous, parse.auteur, parse.ouwie, parse.pgls
	
	all return a vcv (and weight matrix if applicable) which can be used
	in as.unit.tree()
	


set of functions to which calculate summary statistics
	sigsqReml,
	ksPic,
	varPic,
	slopePicBl,
	slopePicAsr,
	slopePicNh
	
	all fxns of form f(unit.tree, data=NULL)
	


defSummStats() makes a list of default summary stats
	


traitStat(unit.tree, data=NULL, stats)
	
	stats in the form of a list. can be inherited from defSummStats
	or can be a custom list
	
	unit.tree can either be a single unit tree or else a list. 
	
	


sim.charUnit(unit.tree, n.sim)

	simulates n.sim datasets on unit.tree (BM with rate 1)
	outputs a set of 'unit.trees', each with a different data object attached
	
	can run traitStat across all of them
	
	

compare.summStat(summ.stats.obs, summ.stats.sim)

	if summ.stats.obs is a vector, get quantile by comparing to sims
	
	if summ.stats.obs if a data.frame (from a Bayesian analysis), perfrom
	a KS test between the two distribution
	(need to then check if same length)
	
	

plot.summStat(summ.stats.obs, summ.stats.sim, stats=NULL, control=list())

	plot the distribution of simulated SS versus observed
	
	works for ML or continuous
	
	the control is the plotting controls (colors, layouts, etc.)
