# Adequacy for phylogenetic trait models

This is the repo for our project on assessing the adequacy of continuous trait models. This is a collaborative effort between Matt Pennell, Rich FitzJohn, Will Cornwell and Luke Harmon. As part of this project, we also developed a R package [arbutus](https://github.com/mwpennell/arbutus) so that researchers can apply our approach to their own data.
